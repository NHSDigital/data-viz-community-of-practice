# Data Visualisation for Health and Care: A Community of Practice

The community was launched in Febuary 2022, and building off the back of our first event as part of Analyst X we formed a committe of folk working in data visualisation across CSUs, Trusts, NHS Digital, NHS England and others.

We aim to:

1) Become the go-to community for people working in data visualisation in health and care
2) Provide a framework for knowledge sharing
3) Support people working across a range of tools, technologies and platforms 
4) Make learning and development material available and accessible to upskill and to professionalise our workforce 
5) Provide an innovative, colloborative and safe space for users to generate ideas
